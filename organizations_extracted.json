    "description": "Friendship Park: Friendship Park is a binational park situated on the U.S.-Mexico border, overlooking the ocean. Since its opening by Pat Nixon 51 years ago, the park has served as a meeting point for families who have been separated by immigration laws. For some families, Friendship Park offers the only opportunity to reunite with loved ones unable to cross the border. Friendship Park, particularly on the Mexico side, has been cultivated by the community into a place of art and gathering, with regular art installations featured and frequent cross-border events like church sermons and yoga classes. (Currently closed, and based on special availability) Visit to Chicano Park and Barrio Logan The epicenter of San Diego’s Mexican-American culture, Barrio Logan is a must-visit for an authentic taste of what it means to live and work in a community with a large immigrant population. Visiting Barrio Logan, and in particular Chicano Park, will demonstrate the social, economic, and political impact of immigration in the San Diego region, and subsequent cultivation of San Diego-specific Chicano communities and culture. We suggest recruiting Via International to accompany the group on a guided tour of the area. Barrio Logan: The Barrio Logan neighborhood has a longstanding tradition of community participation and engagement, which was particularly tested (and thankfully prevailed) with the construction of the Coronado Bridge in the 1960s. Today, Barrio Logan is renowned for its artwork, both in galleries and on the streets, music venues, restaurant options and small business establishments. Walking through the neighborhood with a guide will enable participants to absorb Barrio Logan’s decidedly bi-national ethos, and its embracement of Chicano culture in cultivating a thriving community. Suggested sites of note include Bread & Salt, and “experimental center for the arts with strong community ties”, La Vuelta Car Cruises (glossy, low ride cars are a common sight and of cultural significance in the area), and Mujeres Brew House, a Latina-owned brewery founded as a community group for Latinas and other women interested in craft beer. Chicano Park: To understand the cultural significance of Barrio Logan, one must first explore Chicano Park. While the construction of the Coronado Bridge had the devastating power to fragment the migrant community forming in the area, the community banded together and turned the area under the bridge into a place of gathering and storytelling. Walking through Chicano Park under the Coronado Bridge today, visitors will see the largest concentration of Chicano murals in the world with more than 80 paintings situated on seven acres dotted with sculpture, gardens, picnic tables and playgrounds. The importance of Chicano Park to the Barrio Logan community is summarized by late musician and activist Ramon “Chunky” Sanchez; “There’s an energy there that’s hard to describe – when you see your people struggling for something positive, it’s very inspiring. The park was brought about by sacrifice and it demonstrates what a community can do when they stick together and make it happen.” _______________________________ Cultural Activities San Diego Zoo www.sandiegozoo.org Price: $46 for one Adult Ticket The 100-acre (40-hectare) Zoo is home to over 3,700 rare and endangered animals representing more than 650 species and subspecies, and a prominent botanical collection with more than 700,000 exotic plants.

From here you can link to various informative pages about the SBIWTP located in San Ysidro, CA. The South Bay International Wastewater Treatment Plant (SBIWTP) was designed to deal with the growing demand for the treatment of wastewater resulting in the contamination of the Tijuana River in the United States. It has been an ongoing concern since 1934 when the International Boundary Commission (IBC) was instructed by the United States and Mexican governments to cooperate in the preparation of a report on the Tijuana sewage problem. The SBIWTP can provide secondary treatment for 25 million gallons per day (mgd) average daily flows of sewage more than the Tijuana sewage system capacity but has expansion capability of up to 100 mgd. The SBIWTP was built on a 75-acre site near the international boundary in the U.S. immediately north of Tijuana's main wastewater pumping station. Resulting from the establishment of a binational interagency \"Clean Water Partnership,\" the United States and Mexico approved IBWC Minute No. 283 dated July 8, 1990. This Minute authorized the construction of the SBIWTP. The Government of Mexico contributed $16.8 million toward construction of the SBIWTP and currently contributes $2.0 million toward the annual operation and maintenance costs.",

More than 38% of food produced in the U.S. goes to waste annually, and Feeding San Diego addresses this issue by rescuing high-quality, nutritious surplus food from various donors, including farms and grocery stores. Their flexible decentralized model allows them to choose whether to keep food local or bring it to their distribution center, coordinating with local partners for efficient direct rescue from food donors. This process not only keeps the food fresher but also speeds up the time to distribution, enabling them to serve more people facing hunger. The approach involves three main stages: identifying the needs of the community using data, sourcing needed food through a combination of rescues and purchases and distributing the food in various ways based on community needs. Approximately 76% of the food distributed by Feeding San Diego is rescued, aligning with their commitment to making food rescue a pillar of their method to combat the environmental and economic effects of food waste. Feeding San Diego's impactful work aligns with the global goals of the United Nations, particularly Zero Hunger (SDG 2), Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG 12), Climate Action (SDG 13), and Partnerships (SDG 17).

The city adopted a Zero Waste Plan in 2015 with a goal to reach zero waste by 2040. Zero Waste is a principle that focuses on waste prevention, recycling, composting, and other technologies. Zero waste doesn’t necessarily mean absolutely having no waste in the landfill; it’s a continuous improvement process striving to produce as little waste or discards as possible. San Diego is now capturing the gasses from decomposition and turning them into energy. The City's recycling programs reuse materials and divert waste from the Miramar Landfill. A Resource Recovery Center and “one-stop shop” at Miramar Landfill maximizes waste diversion. The city continuously works on increasing curbside recycling and curbside greenery collection.",

    "description": "The SBIWTP is a 25 million gallon per day secondary treatment plant located in San Diego County, California, about 2 miles west of the San Ysidro Port of Entry. The plant treats sewage originating in Tijuana, Mexico and discharges it to the Pacific Ocean through the South Bay Ocean Outfall, a four and one-half mile long 11foot diameter pipe completed in January 1999. From here you can link to various informative pages about the SBIWTP located in San Ysidro, CA. The South Bay International Wastewater Treatment Plant (SBIWTP) was designed to deal with the growing demand for the treatment of wastewater resulting in the contamination of the Tijuana River in the United States. It has been an ongoing concern since 1934 when the International Boundary Commission (IBC) was instructed by the United States and Mexican governments to cooperate in the preparation of a report on the Tijuana sewage problem. The SBIWTP is capable of providing secondary treatment for 25 million gallons per day (mgd) average daily flows of sewage in excess of the Tijuana sewage system capacity but has expansion capability of up to 100 mgd. The SBIWTP was built on a 75-acre site near the international boundary in the U.S. immediately north of Tijuana's main wastewater pumping station. Resulting from the establishment of a binational interagency \"Clean Water Partnership,\" the United States and Mexico approved IBWC Minute No. 283 dated July 8, 1990. This Minute authorized the construction of the SBIWTP. The Government of Mexico contributed $16.8 million toward construction of the SBIWTP and currently contributes $2.0 million toward the annual operation and maintenance costs.",

The Department is home to 750 undergraduate majors, approximately 50 doctoral students, and 24 ladder-rank and affiliated faculty. Patty Ahn, Ph.D. Assistant Teaching Professor Ppatty Ahn earned their Ph.D. in Cirtical Studies from the University of Southern California, where they developed a research and teaching interest in contemporary Korean and Korean American political economic and cultural history; postcolonial and feminist theory; cultural theories of global media with an emphasis on hallyu (the Korean Wave); and digital storytelling and transmedia activism. Drawing from their background as a community organizer and commercial producer, their work integrates interdisciplinary media research, critical media practice and community-based models of teaching.

Boatema Boateng, Ph.D. Associate Professor Dr. Boateng’s research interests include Critical Legal Studies, Critical Race Studies, Cultural Studies, Transnational Gender Studies, and African Diaspora Studies. Her research projects focus on the regulatory dimensions of knowledge and its production, as embedded in legal (and other) regimes and in cultural objects and practices. In her book, The Copyright Thing Doesn't Work Here: Adinkra and Kente Cloth and Intellectual Property in Ghana, she examines the ways that intellectual property law converges with histories of subjugation along lines of nation, gender and race to produce and regulate both subjects and knowledge. She argues that the status of different kinds of knowledge and culture within the law is a function not only of their inherent qualities but also of their location in such histories. In addition, she examines devalued conceptions of knowledge and subjectivity as resources for challenging and critically rethinking intellectual property law. Her current research takes a similar historical perspective in examining U.S. copyright law in relation to the categories of \"art\" and \"craft\"; and the racial and gendered consequences of that relation for cultural production Meeting focus: Discuss Dr. Boateng’s research on U.S. copyright law and how they affect communication, investigation, and public perception; and the racial and gendered consequences of these relations for cultural production.",

    "description": "The SBIWTP is a 25 million gallon per day secondary treatment plant located in San Diego County, California, about 2 miles west of the San Ysidro Port of Entry. The plant treats sewage originating in Tijuana, Mexico and discharges it to the Pacific Ocean through the South Bay Ocean Outfall, a four and one-half mile long 11foot diameter pipe completed in January 1999. From here you can link to various informative pages about the SBIWTP located in San Ysidro, CA. The South Bay International Wastewater Treatment Plant (SBIWTP) was designed to deal with the growing demand for the treatment of wastewater resulting in the contamination of the Tijuana River in the United States. It has been an ongoing concern since 1934 when the International Boundary Commission (IBC) was instructed by the United States and Mexican governments to cooperate in the preparation of a report on the Tijuana sewage problem. The SBIWTP is capable of providing secondary treatment for 25 million gallons per day (mgd) average daily flows of sewage in excess of the Tijuana sewage system capacity but has expansion capability of up to 100 mgd. The SBIWTP was built on a 75-acre site near the international boundary in the U.S. immediately north of Tijuana's main wastewater pumping station. Resulting from the establishment of a binational interagency \"Clean Water Partnership,\" the United States and Mexico approved IBWC Minute No. 283 dated July 8, 1990. This Minute authorized the construction of the SBIWTP. The Government of Mexico contributed $16.8 million toward construction of the SBIWTP and currently contributes $2.0 million toward the annual operation and maintenance costs. _______________________________ Cultural Activities San Diego Zoo www.sandiegozoo.org Price: $62 for one Adult Ticket The 100-acre (40-hectare) Zoo is home to over 3,700 rare and endangered animals representing more than 650 species and subspecies, and a prominent botanical collection with more than 700,000 exotic plants.

Better and fairer capital investments will require changes in previous routines and will not always come easily.  Yet in San Diego, a well-designed and clearly authorized equity office that connects performance to well-visualized data show the way. Kim Desmond, the Chief of Race and Equity and Kirby Brady, Chief Innovation Officer for Mayor Todd Gloria in San Diego provide three principles and a guide for other cities looking to convert their data and equity work into infrastructure results.  The first principle deals with structure—the location of the department, its direct line of authority to a committed elected executive and its relationship to the agency responsible for performance management. The second deals with visualization – the importance of locational intelligence and mapping as both a way to understand data and to communicate its meaning. The third and final principle is in checking biases – how to identify them both within operations and within the data.",

Case Study: Smart City Street Light Initiative Announced in 2017 as “the world’s largest smart city platform”, the city of San Diego implemented a new streetlight program, featuring 3,200 streetlights, to “enhance public safety”. Since its launch, however, the system was often used for non-disclosed policing. In 2018, the San Diego Police Department secretly and repeatedly accessed video footage from the city’s streetlights, despite existing guidelines stipulating against use of footage for this purpose. In summer 2020, the Police Department accessed recordings more than 35 times within two weeks, to identify and prosecute Black Lives Matter protestors. In September 2020, the City of San Diego announced that all smart streetlights were being deactivated, until a new ordinance is in place governing the programme.",

Within an hour of notification, SART staff can be ready to care for sexual assault victims and give them the undivided attention that is so important during this time. Once there, they undergo a three-hour interview and exam process conducted by specially trained care givers. Often the evidence gathered by members of SART is so strong and compelling that suspects will admit their guilt, sparing victims the necessity of testifying in a public court room San Diego Police Department, Domestic Violence Unit San Diego Police Department's (SDPD) Domestic Violence Unit is located within the Your Safe Place - A Family Justice Center, which houses public and private agencies that work together to address domestic violence.

    "description": "Researchers at the UC San Diego School of Medicine, along with San Diego State University (SDSU) and international collaborators, have developed a prediction model to identify counties at risk of future overdose death outbreaks. This open-source tool aims to predict and prevent deaths by enabling the early deployment of public health resources. Researchers have also explored the opioid epidemic through the rise in fentanyl-related overdoses. The research focuses on understanding the patterns of fatal overdoses due to prescription opioids, heroin, and highly potent synthetic opioids like fentanyl. The goal is to develop tools for predicting and preventing overdose deaths. Finally, UC San Diego's Health Promotion Services launched a campus-wide naloxone distribution zone, providing naloxone nasal spray and fentanyl test strips for pick-up at the Student Health Services building. This initiative aims to address the significant impact of fentanyl on drug overdoses and its lethal potency, even in small amounts.",

    "description": "San Diego State University is the oldest higher-education institute in San Diego. The SDSU community is home to many initiatives, groups, faculty and students exploring civic engagement, community activism and leadership development. Dr. Lisa Gates Dr. Lisa Gates publishes in the fields of Leadership and Communication and is a radically compassionate, equity-minded educator who embodies an abiding fidelity to students. She is committed to student success evidenced by numerous awards for outstanding instruction and advising and, more importantly, through the achievements of her students. She treats students like family -- which means leading with love and compassion and also challenging them to pivot when needed. She views teaching as a communicative act constituted by thoughtful consideration of the actual students present in the learning environment. Lisa has met with many IVLP groups in the past, exploring participants’ understanding of how to strengthen youth leadership capacities – how programs can deepen young people’s understanding of their own aspirations, their roles in their communities, and their leadership styles. Dr. Michael Domínguez Michael Domínguez is Assistant Professor in the department with a focus on youth studies and education. he is passionate about supporting emerging researchers of color, and is presently an instructor for the General Studies program, teaching a course that involves undergraduate students in service-learning and ethnographic field research, while providing them with mentorship as they learn to connect research activities to civic and community outcomes. Dr. Domínguez’ scholarship and research interests focus on the schooling experiences of Chican@ and historically marginalized youth, school athletics and race, Teatro del Oprimido, and liberatory teacher education. He is particularly interested in issues of youth identity construction, socio-political and socio-emotional development, racialization, affect, and community and family ingenuity, as well as decolonizing teaching and teacher education. Dr. Godfried Asante As an educator, Dr. Asante believes he has a responsibility to prepare future and current students for the complex roles they will full fill as parents, community leaders, politicians, and more. He views the classroom as an extension of the “real world” and not outside of it. Based on this belief, he engages his students in critical dialogues where they respectfully challenge each other’s ideas while thinking through local and global issues. An emphasis on critical dialogue is driven by his desire for community-engaged learning, where students critically examine social issues by working with community members. In this way, students see the learning process as not only confined to the classroom but as a collaborative process with their communities. Dr. Asante believes that SDSU stands to make significant contributions to changing this country’s future leaders and is excited to be a part of that legacy. Dr. Jess Whatcott Dr. Whatcott (they/them/theirs) is an interdisciplinary scholar studying state violence through the frameworks of critical disability studies, critical prison studies, and queer studies/queer of color critique. Dr. Whatcott’s current research examines the historic and current relations between carcerality and eugenics, as well as how queer and disabled people resist state violence. In addition to their appointment in Women’s Studies at SDSU, Dr. Whatcott is affiliated with LGBTQ+ Studies and the Digital Humanities Initiative. Digital Humanities Initiative The Digital Humanities Initiative at SDSU (DH@SDSU) was founded to promote such critical engagement by providing a hub for strategic innovation and collaboration across campus. Their goal is to serve faculty and students by providing expertise in digital tools, and to model how collaboration elevates teaching, learning and sense of humanness. Barrio Logan College Institute www.blci.org Barrio Logan College Institute is located in Barrio Logan, a part of the San Diego community that is rich in culture but underserved in resources. Their mission is to break the cycle of poverty by preparing students to be the first in their families to go to college through after school programs that begin in third grade. Located in a traditionally low-income community, BLCI promotes higher education as a ticket out of poverty. To date, 100% of Barrio Logan College Institute’s students have enrolled in college.

    "description": "The SBIWTP is a 25 million gallon per day secondary treatment plant located in San Diego County, California, about 2 miles west of the San Ysidro Port of Entry. The plant treats sewage originating in Tijuana, Mexico and discharges it to the Pacific Ocean through the South Bay Ocean Outfall, a four-and-a-half-mile-long 11-foot diameter pipe completed in January 1999. The South Bay International Wastewater Treatment Plant (SBIWTP) was designed to deal with the growing demand for the treatment of wastewater resulting in the contamination of the Tijuana River in the United States. It has been an ongoing concern since 1934, when the International Boundary Commission (IBC) was instructed by the United States and Mexican governments to cooperate in the preparation of a report on the Tijuana sewage problem. The SBIWTP can provide secondary treatment for 25 million gallons per day (mgd) average daily flows of sewage, more than the Tijuana sewage system capacity, but has expansion capability of up to 100 mgd. The SBIWTP was built on a 75-acre site near the international boundary in the U.S. immediately north of Tijuana's main wastewater pumping station. Resulting from the establishment of a binational interagency \"Clean Water Partnership,\" the United States and Mexico approved IBWC Minute No. 283 dated July 8, 1990. This Minute authorized the construction of the SBIWTP. The Government of Mexico contributed $16.8 million toward construction of the SBIWTP and currently contributes $2.0 million toward the annual operation and maintenance costs.",

It provides reliable baseload and peaking power to the California grid, while its location makes it a key component in regional cross-border energy flows. The facility uses advanced combined-cycle technology, which increases efficiency by capturing and reusing waste heat from gas turbines to produce additional electricity. Operated under the oversight of the California Energy Commission, Otay Mesa supports grid reliability during periods of peak demand and extreme weather. Its proximity to natural gas pipelines and international transmission lines positions it as a strategic site for U.S.–Mexico energy integration. The center also plays a role in balancing energy sources by providing stable generation when solar or wind production fluctuates. Border Project (Otay Mesa, San Diego) https://www.energy.ca.gov/powerplant/simple-cycle/border-project The Border Project is a 49.5-megawatt simple-cycle natural gas-fired facility located in the Otay Mesa section of San Diego, just north of the U.S.–Mexico border. Owned by CalPeak Power, the plant began operation in 2001 under emergency authorization to address California’s electricity shortages. It uses a Pratt & Whitney Twinpac turbine system and incorporates selective catalytic reduction to reduce emissions. Originally permitted as a peaking facility to meet demand surges, the plant has since been granted long-term certification by the California Energy Commission. In 2022, the site was approved to integrate a battery energy storage system (Border BESS), marking its evolution into a hybrid facility that combines traditional and renewable-supporting technologies. This dual role highlights California’s approach to balancing natural gas reliability with renewable energy integration. Border’s location near the U.S.–Mexico border makes it strategically important for regional grid stability and potential cross-border energy flows.",

    "description": "Youth Voice aims to create safer communities by educating and empowering youth to realize their potential and become solution-oriented activists. This unique and innovative initiative helps youth recognize their innate gifts, collaborate with peers, engage in community service, advocate for their community, develop public speaking skills, and develop the leadership abilities to partner with community groups and law enforcement agencies. Providing our youth with leadership opportunities helps them grow into responsible and engaged members of their community. By giving them the chance to develop effective life skills—skills that allow them to manage time, work as a team, set goals, solve problems, facilitate meetings, defend positions, and make effective presentations—we ensure a successful trajectory where they can lead their peers through community challenges.
